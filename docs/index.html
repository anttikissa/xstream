<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote><p>&quot;It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than
10 functions on 10 data structures.&quot; —Alan Perlis
</blockquote>
<p>This library is about streams.
<p>A stream has two interesting properties:
<ul>
<li>It has a <i>a current value</i> (which may be <code>undefined</code>)
<li>It <i>broadcasts</i> its value when it&#39;s updated
</ul>
<p>An example of using streams:
<pre class=code>var s1 = stream();
var s2 = stream();
var s3 = stream.combine(s1, s2, function(a, b) { return a + b });
s1.update(1);
s2.update(2);
s3.forEach(function(value) {
    console.log(value);
});

stream.tick();
// -&gt; 3</pre>
<p>That&#39;s it.  Mostly.
<h3>Streams: three perspectives</h3>
<p>You can view streams from different perspectives.
<ol>
<li>Streams as data-flow graphs
</ol>
<p>Streams form a network of nodes, where some nodes act as sources and
others derive values from them.  The focus is on the <i>values</i> of the
nodes.  Communication happens whenever a value somewhere changes, and
the rest of the nodes receive their right values automatically and
atomically.
<p>Signals in FRP (?); Properties of Bacon.js; some kind of Observables in
RxJS; Likely mostly <code>map</code>, <code>combine</code>, and the ilk (not much else?)
<ol start=2>
<li>Streams as event sources
</ol>
<p>We&#39;re interested in what happens when streams update; in other words,
<i>update events</i>.  Sometimes we want some data with the events (for
example, coordinates associated with a mouse click), sometimes we&#39;re
just interested in the fact that the event happened (for example, a
&quot;Dismiss&quot; button was pressed).
<p>There is still a graph, as event streams may be filtered, mapped,
collected, etc. into other meaningful streams.  But the operations that
are performed are likely different.  <code>merge</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>sampledBy</code>,
etc. TODO complete this analysis after actually writing something.
<ol start=3>
<li>Streams as data structures
</ol>
<p>In this views, streams are treated like a kind of asynchronous arrays
whose values are spread out in time.
The fact that streams can be updated is just an implementation artifact
to... (or:) Ticks/transactions are used not for synchronizing data
updates but as a means of iteration.
<p>TODO talk about ticks.
<h2>A sketch</h2>
<h3>Simple dependencies: .map, .filter, .combine</h3>
<h3>merge</h3>
<h3>Maybe .reduce too</h3>
<h3>stream.from() &ndash; kitchen sink</h3>
<h3>rewire</h3>
<h3>what does <code>tick()</code> do?</h3>
<h3>Some nice examples (fibonacci? snake?)</h3>
<p>Maybe to its own chapter:
<h2>Time-based things (eventually)</h2>
<h3>delay (both for ticks and millisecond timeouts)
### pause(), play(), etc.</h3>
<h2>Errors, ends, and broken things</h2>
<p>In the real world, a stream of values is not always enough.  Sometimes
<ul>
<li>streams <i>end</i>, and we want to react when it happens
<li>streams have <i>errors</i>, and we&#39;re interested in them as well
</ul>
<p>A stream can update and end within the same tick, provided that the
update happens first:
<pre class=code>var s = stream();
s.onEnd(log);
s.update(1);
s.end();
s.tick();
// -&gt; 1</pre>
<p>But you can&#39;t call <code>update</code> after the stream has ended:
<pre class=code>var s2 = stream();
s2.onEnd(log);
s2.update(1);
s2.end();
s2.tick();
// -&gt; 1
s2.update(2);
try {
    s2.tick();
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.message);
}
// -&gt; cannot update ended stream</pre>
<p>Streams created by <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> end when the parent stream ends:
<pre class=code>var s = stream();
var s2 = s.map(stream.util.inc);
var s3 = s2.reduce(stream.util.plus, 5);

s.onEnd(function(x) { console.log(&#39;s ends with&#39;, x); });
s2.onEnd(function(x) { console.log(&#39;s2 ends with&#39;, x); });
s3.onEnd(function(x) { console.log(&#39;s3 ends with&#39;, x); });
s.update(10);
s.end();
stream.tick();
// -&gt; s ends with 10; s2 ends with 11; s3 ends with 16</pre>
<p>Errors are like ends; the only difference is the <code>catch</code> and <code>finally</code>
helpers used to handle errors.  You trigger an exception by calling
<code>s.error(error)</code>, and catch them by listening to stream <code>s.errors()</code> or
by installing a <code>catch</code> handler: 
<pre class=code>return; // TODO test disabled
s = stream.ajax(&#39;http://foobar.com/api/user/123.json&#39;);
s.onEnd(function(result) {
    // ok, we have &#39;result&#39;
});
s.errors().forEach(function(error) {
    // called for all errors
});
s.catch(SomeException, function(error) {
    // called for SomeExceptions
}).catch(SyntaxError, function(error) {
    // called for SyntaxErrors
}).catch(function(error) {
    // we have some other kind of error
});</pre>
<p>Finally, we have <code>finally</code>, which executes its argument when the stream
either ends or encounters an error:
<pre class=code>return; // TODO test disabled
s.finally(function() {
    // do something;
});</pre>
<p>As an implementation artifact (because it&#39;s implemented as <code>finally =
function(f) { this.ends().forEach(f); this.errors().forEach(f); }</code>), the
<code>finally</code> handler is called with either the last value or the error, but
you don&#39;t know which.
<h2>Metastreams</h2>
<p>Metastreams are streams of streams.
<p>It&#39;s not as confusing as it sounds.  You can see stream as a unit of
computation that produces some sequence of values as its output.
Whereas usual streams consist of values, you can think of metastreams
as a sequence of processes that produce output.  There are a few
operators that you can use to collect that output in useful ways:
<p>Let&#39;s take an example.
<pre class=code>// For letters a, b, and c
var pairs = stream.fromString(&#39;abc&#39;).map(function(letter) {
    // Return a stream that produces values like &#39;a1&#39;, &#39;a2&#39;, and &#39;a3&#39;
    return stream.fromRange(1, 3).map(function(number) {
        return letter + number;
    });
});

// To read all of the values in parallel, you could do this:
pairs.forEach(function(stream) {
    stream.forEach(function(value) {
        console.log(value);
    });
});

// Let&#39;s see what the output becomes, tick by tick:
pairs.tick(2);
// -&gt; a1
pairs.tick();
// -&gt; a2; b1
pairs.tick();
// -&gt; a3; b2; c1
pairs.tick();
// -&gt; b3; c2
pairs.tick();
// -&gt; c3</pre>
<p>Or then you could use the operator .mergeStream() to achieve the same:
<pre class=code>// For letters a, b, and c
var pairs = stream.fromString(&#39;abc&#39;).map(function(letter) {
    // Return a stream that produces values like &#39;a1&#39;, &#39;a2&#39;, and &#39;a3&#39;
    return stream.fromRange(1, 3).map(function(number) {
        return letter + number;
    });
});</pre>
<p>//  pairs.mergeStream().forEach(function(value) {
//      console.log(value);
//  });
//
//  // -&gt;
<p>The basic operators of metastreams are 
<h2>The juicy parts</h2>
<p>This chapter attempts to answers two questions:
<ul>
<li>how does this thing work,
<li>how would I implement my own combinators like <code>.map</code>, <code>.combine</code>, etc?
</ul>
<h2>How to implement iterators like .fromArray()</h2>
<p>TODO is &#39;iterator&#39; the name we want to use here?
<p>Iterator streams, like those produced by <code>.fromArray</code>, <code>.fromString</code>, or
<code>.fromRange</code>, share a few conventions.  They set the <code>state</code> member of
the stream to whatever state they need to complete the iteration, and
the <code>next</code> member of the stream to a function that performs one step
of the iteration.  Then they update the resulting stream with its
initial value (by calling it&#39;s <code>next</code> method, or otherwise), and finally
make sure <code>next</code> gets called on each tick by calling <code>.forEach(result.next)</code>
<p>Here&#39;s a the blueprint of a function that creates an iterator stream:
<pre class=code>function iteratorStream(args) {
    var result = stream();
    result.state = &quot;some state here&quot;;
    result.next = function next() {
        if (&quot;end condition for iteration, using .state&quot;) {
            return this.end();
        }

        var newValue = &quot;iterate one step, change .state accordingly&quot;;
        this.update(newValue);
    };

    result.next(); // OR result.update(initialValue);
    return result.forEach(result.next);
}</pre>
<p>For instance, to create a stream that factorizes a number:
<pre class=code>// Is x a factor of y?
function isFactor(x, y) {
    return !((y / x) % 1);
}

// Return the lowest factor of number.
function lowestFactor(number) {
    for (var i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
        if (isFactor(i, number)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return number;
}

function factorize(number) {
    var result = stream();
    result.state = number;

    result.next = function next() {
        if (this.state === 1) {
            return this.end();
        }

        var factor = lowestFactor(this.state);
        this.state = this.state / factor;
        this.update(factor);
    };

    result.next();

    return result.forEach(result.next);
}

factorize(2002).forEach(function(factor) {
    console.log(factor);
});
stream.tick(4);
// -&gt; 2; 7; 11; 13</pre>

<h3>taking care of .ends(), .errors()</h3>
<h3>rewire</h3>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>What principles guided the design of the internals?
<p>Debuggability
<p>Readability
<p>Power to the people (the tools used to implement primitives such as
<code>map</code> and `filter&#39; should be given to any user of the library)
<p>Managing complexity: this library attempts to do many different things
at once, so it&#39;s on an inevitable path towards death by complexity.  How
to manage complexity?
<p>Attempts to tackle complexity by itself are doomed to fail.  The only
possible solution is to cut its roots one by one.  You can never beat
complexity, but you can find spots where you can coexist with it.
<ul>
<li>solving a simple problem at a time
<li>figure out a locally applicable solution that works reasonably well
within the specified constraints.  
<li>more complex behavior may emerge out of these simple solutions (and comes without warranty)
</ul>
<p>Example? &quot;Atomic value propagation&quot; is one problem.
<p>&quot;Iterating over streams such that streams are kept synchronized&quot; is
another.
<p>&quot;That .end() should work in reasonable cases&quot; is a problem.
<p>, user should be able to implement any of the
primitives by themselves
<p>Design
<h3>How to read the source code</h3>
<p>Conventions, figure out a good format for type signatures
Should pick a convention for argument names, a, b, c / x, y, z, or something
<p>Maybe also a part:
<h2>Practical development</h2>
<ul>
<li>Debugging
<li>performance analysis
<li>making sure things are garbage collected, etc.
</ul>
<p>whenever that information becomes available.
<h2>Utils</h2>
<ul>
<li>lots of these, probably will need
<li>plus, inc, mul, count, min, max, pluck, limit, etc.
</ul>
<h2>Transactions</h2>
<blockquote><p>&quot;And I didn&#39;t have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click so
we put a click on the 24 track which then was synced to the moog
modular.&quot; —Giorgio Moroder
</blockquote>
<p>As we&#39;ve seen, transactions are what make streams tick.
<p>Quite literally so, as the function <code>stream.tick()</code> is what is used to complete a
transaction.
<p>TODO this is fiction still
<pre class=code>var s = stream();
s.update(123);
s.forEach(function(value) { console.log(value); });
stream.tick();
// -&gt; 123
s.update(234);
stream.tick();
// -&gt; 234</pre>
<h3>Open issues</h3>
<p>How should we manage time?
<p>E.g. we want things to happen &#39;on the next tick&#39;.
<pre class=code>var s = stream.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
//  var s2 = d.delayOneTick();
// to make the tests pass
var s2 = s.map(function(x) { return x + 1; });
var s3 = stream.combine(s, s2, stream.util.plus);

// s    1    2   3   4   5
// s2        1   2   3   4   5
// s3   NaN  3   5   7   9   10</pre>
<p>We also want combineWhenAll or something to filter out <code>undefined</code>s.
<p>How to implement ticks, then?
<pre class=code>stream.prototype.delayOneTick = function() {
    var result = stream();
    this.forEach(function(value) {
        result.update(value);
    });
}</pre>
<p><code>.forEach</code> is always called at the end of the transaction and hence is
guaranteed to provide consistent results for all <code>.forEach()</code> listeners
that are called within a transaction.
<p>Therefore, <code>stream.fromArray([1,2,3,4])</code> and friends should use
<code>.forEach</code> as well.
