This library is about streams.

A stream has two interesting properties:

- It has a /a current value/ (which may be `undefined`)
- It /broadcasts/ its value when it's updated

An example of using streams:

	var s1 = stream();
	var s2 = stream();
	var s3 = stream.combine(s1, s2, function(a, b) { return a + b });
	s3.forEach(value

	s1. 

That's it.  Mostly.
